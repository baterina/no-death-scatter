## NoDeathScatter

This is a plugin that prevents the items from scattering on the floor when a player dies. All the items stay near the place of death.

> [!WARNING]
> This is NOT a graves plugin, this plugin doesn't add any functionality for player graves.
>
> The items can still despawn after the timeout.
